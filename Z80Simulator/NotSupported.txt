Known limitations :
- fourth machine cycle of four bytes opcodes has been implemented as OCF(5), which triggers M1 and increases the Refresh register
(this is logical but contradicts Sean Young's assertion that four bytes opcodes increase only twice the Refresh register)
- only supports single byte opcodes on the databus in maskable interrupt mode 0
- did not know how to emulate the undocumented flags YF and XF in the BIT n,(HL) instruction : chose to copy them fom ALULeftBuffer
(are copied from "some sort of internal register related to 16 bits additions")
- not sure if the input/output/memory block instructions flags are accurate
