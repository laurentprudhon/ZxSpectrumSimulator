A 'T-state' is the counting value as used by the Z80 processor itself and is the time length of 1 clock pulse. 
As the Z80 in a ZX Spectrum runs at 3.5 MHz, 1 T-state has a duration of 1/3,500,000 seconds. 

A 'pulse' is one half sine wave (1) and a 'joined pulse' is one full sine wave (2). 
So 2 pulses make a complete sine wave cycle. 

First of all, let's see how a tape block is organised: 

1.A block starts with a pilot signal. 
This 'tells' the loading routine that a new block is starting. 
The Spectrum ROM needs this pilot tone to be more than 1 second in duration. 

2.After the pilot come 2 sync pulses, which are significantly smaller than a pilot pulse. 
This marks the end of the pilot. 

3.Then comes the datablock. 
1 bit of data is composed of 2 equal pulses. 
The length of the pulses determines whether it's a '0' or a '1' bit. 
Usually, a '1' bit pulse will be twice as long as a '0' bit pulse. 
The amplitude of each pulse is not important, as the loading routines are 'edge-triggered' rather than 'level-triggered'. 

4.A block is always ended in one of two ways: 
- a pause 
- the next pilot 

Standard timings :

Pilot tone: before each block is a sequence of 8063 (header) or 3223 (data) pulses, each of length 2168 T-states. 
Sync pulses: the pilot tone is followed by two sync pulses of 667 and 735 T-states resp. 
A '0' bit is encoded as 2 pulses of 855 T-states each. 
A '1' bit is encoded as 2 pulses of 1710 T-states each (ie. twice the length of a '0') .
