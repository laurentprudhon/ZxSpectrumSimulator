# ZxSpectrumSimulator
Accurate simulation of a Z80 CPU and of a ZxSpectrum computer at the electronic level
Based on the book "The ZX Spectrum Ula: How to Design a Microcomputer", full reconstruction of the ZxSpectrum computer in software at the wire and clock signals level. 
You can load all original ZxSpectrum games from tape captures and play !
The goal was to deeply understand the inner workings of a CPU and a rudimentary computer - with all its peripherals - at the electronic level, and to understand its operating system in assembly language.
