INTRODUCTION
Buggy Boy is the ultimate driving challenge. Be prepared for 
the bumpiest ride of your life, over five of the roughest 
courses ever devised for four wheels. You must race across 
terrain littered with boulders, trees, brickwalls and fences 
whilst following the rough outline of the track through narrow 
valleys, across even narrower bridges and through dark 
tunnels. 
Use your skill to dodge these obstacles or a jump over them by 
hitting the logs that lie across the track, sending your buggy 
soaring through the air. Driving over tree stumps and small 
rocks will tilt your buggy onto two wheels allowing you to 
squeeze through narrow gaps; but don´t oversteer, as you will 
lose control and return to four wheel drive! 
The course is not your only eneamy. The clock is ticking and 
you will be disqualified from the race if you do not complete 
each leg in the allowed time limit. Extra time for the next 
leg can be collected by driving through the dangerously placed 
"time" gates. For each "time" gate you drive through, you get 
two seconds bonus time for the next leg after completion of 
the actual one. 
Additional points are scored by collecting the flags and 
driving through the score gates. Collecting the flags in the 
specified order (displayed in the upper right corner of the 
screen) will give you a larger bonus, as will bumping into the 
football! 
When the going gets tough, put your foot to the floor (finger 
on the button?) and get ready for more thrills and spills then 
ever before.
