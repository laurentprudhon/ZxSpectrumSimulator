 BEYOND THE ICE PALACE
 Elite 1988

 CONTROLS : Keyboard, Cursor, Kempston
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 AIM : Beyond the Ice Palace lies a mystical land caught up in a
 battle between good and evil. Dark spirits are setting alight the
 forests, destroying the homes and livelihood of simple woodcutters. In
 desperation the ancient and wise spirits of the woods shoot a sacred
 arrow into the air. Whoever finds it will be able to destroy the
 powers of darkness...

 GAMEPLAY : Like any other platform game - you run, jump and duck
 through a horizontally scrolling landscape, avoiding the various
 creatures and their shots. You can collect various weapons of
 differing strengths, ranging from a knife to a fireball. They have
 individual effects on various creatures, some of which need to be shot
 several times.

  Two Spirits of the Forest accompany you on your journey. When
 activated via the keyboard they sacrifice themselves in order to
 reduce the power of the enemies currently on the screen, weakening
 some and killing others. Extra spirits and bonus icons, which boost
 points, are scattered around the land.

 COMMENTS : "A slick, playable and extremely compelling arcade
 adventure."
 RATING : 83% (CRASH #53, June 1988)

 NOW : An average platform game. Appeared on the Atari ST and Amiga
 in 1988 (rather better versions, it has to be said).
