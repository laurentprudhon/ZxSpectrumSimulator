BARBARIAN 2
Publisher: Palace Software, 1988.

PROLOGUE
--------
At the finale of BARBARIAN - THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR, the Barbarian 
defeated the warriors of Drax and thus freed Princess Mariana from his 
evil spell. 

Drax fled to the dungeons beneath his black castle, vowing to wreak 
disaster on the jewelled Kingdom. It is decided that there is only one 
way to stop Drax. The Barbarian and Mariana- herself an accomplished 
swordsman - are the only two warriors skilled enough to survive the 
perilous journey to Drax's lair. They must stop him before it's too 
late. 

LEVELS 
------
You must fight your way through three levels - the Wastelands, the 
Caverns, and the Dungeons - before arriving at the fourth level, the 
inner Sanctum of Drax. These sections must be played in the correct 
order. 

Each of the first three levels is a maze consisting of approximately 
28 screens. As you view each screen it is possible to walk left, right 
or into doors or caves at the back of the screen. 

The direction you are walking, as viewed on a map, is continually 
changing and therefore a compass (in which sword always points north) 
has been provided at the bottom of the screen. When you reach the exit 
to the next level Display will pulse as a warning. It is not advisable 
to leave without first collecting all available magical objects (see 
below.) 

MONSTERS 
On each of the first three levels you must fight six different types 
of monster, some of which can be killed with one well placed blow. 
They are: 

The Wastelands: Wastelands Saurian beasts, Neanderthal men*, Apes, 
                Mutant Chickens*, Stabbers, Floaters. 

The Caverns: Caverns Carnivores, Orc Guards*, Crabs, Slithering Things*
             Cave Trolls, Stingers. 

The Dungeons: Dungeon Pit Things, Dungeon Masters*, Giant Grubs, 
              Gobblers*, Eyes, Orclets. 

*= These Monsters can be killed with a single blow !! 

If you survive to the Sanctum of Drax you must face The Living idol, a 
great Demon and finally the dreaded Drax. 

MAGICAL OBJECTS 
---------------
In each of the three levels there are 2 magical objects that you will 
need to collect in order to survive throughout the quest. 

* The AXE increases your strength 
* The GLOBE guards against death from Drax's magic 
* The POTION increases your resistance 
* The KEY opens portcullis doors 
* The SHIELD guards against instant death from the Demon's fire 
* The JEWEL disables the Living Idol when the idol is reached. 


ENERGY AND LIVES 
Your energy is displayed as a bar at the top right of the screen. When 
it runs out you lose a life. 

You start the game with five lives. More lives can be gained 
throughout the game by collecting skulls you may find. These contain 
the life-force of warriors who have preceded you. When you lose all 
your lives you restart the current level. 

The energy of the current monster you are fighting is displayed as a 
bar at the top left of the screen. When it runs out the monster is 
destroyed. 

SCORING 
The more difficult fighting moves will score highly and do more damage.

KEYBOARD MOVES 
      Q = run
      A = "U turn"
    O/P = walk left/right
  Space = fire (hold and then Q/A/O/P to make different attacks)
Caps Sh.= PAUSE 
      N = THROUGH DOOR 
Space (while paused) = QUIT 
Space (while running) = JUMP

To jump across holes or pits you will need to make a running jump. If 
you do not far enough you will find yourself teetering on the far edge 
of the hole. By swiftly waggling the joystick left or right you may 
save yourself.
