 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 AIM : The Mystery Machine arrives at the ruined castle, and the gang
climb out, ready to explore. Suddenly, Velma, Shaggy, Daphne and Fred
are seized by large hands and a chorus of voices cry out, "Our
experiments are almost complete. Nothing can stop us now!" Though
frightened, Scooby decides to looks for his friends, but soon has the
feeling that he is not alone. Ghosts and demons of the strangest kind
gather on all sides and appear out of doorways, intent on stopping him
freeeing the rest of the gang. Can you, as Scooby Doo, fight your way
through the mad scientists' henchmen to rescue your friends, then seek
out their captors? Perhaps the trail of Scooby Snax may help you in
your search.

 COMMENTS : "A really cool arcade game."
 RATING : 91% (CRASH #33, October 1986)

 NOW : Although SCOOBY DOO's got nice graphics (absolutely spot-on
in comparison with the cartoon) it doesn't have much in the way of
gameplay. It is, however, briefly enjoyable!
