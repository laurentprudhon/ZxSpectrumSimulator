SCENARIO
It is 1942, and war is raging in the Pacific. The enemy's fleet and airforce
are growing in strength. It is up to you to restrict their numbers in a
daring solo mission. Your carrier will take you as far as it dares, but
from then on you are on your own. Fly your plane over enemy territory and
installations, scattered islands and rough terrain. Smart manoeuvring and
skillful aerobatics are required to outwit the enemy planes; recovering
the mystery POWer capsules will give your plane extra capabilities. Be
prepared - enemy gunners have their sights set on you, and their pilots are
prepared to die to thwart your mission. The carrier awaits your safe return
- but have you the skill to survive?!
