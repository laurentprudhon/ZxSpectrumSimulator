CRAZY GOLF
This fun game features unique graphic obstacles which must be circumvented
before the ball can be "putted" into the hole.

The part for each hole is displayed, and a novel direction pointed combined
with the force indicator enable you to try to equal or better par.

Owners of the Currah U-Speech add-on Module will be able to hear the "useful"
and "enlightened" comments of the speaking caddy. Use with keyboard or
joystick.

CRAZY GOLF IS CRAZY BUT FUN FOR EVERYONE.
