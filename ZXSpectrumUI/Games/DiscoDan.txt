DISCO DAN
Can poor Dan decontaminate the atomic fuel rods in time? In this new 3D
machine code game, you control Dan Dan The Atomiser Man, jumping him from
disc to disc, trying to reduce the ever increasing radiation levels in an
atomic pile.

However, Up 'n' Atom 'Arry and his gang of vagrant particles are thirsting
for the energy in your back pack, which makes life a bit awkward at times.
Then there's Ron the Rapacious Robot, not the sort to meet in a dark alley
(or anywhere else for that matter)!!
