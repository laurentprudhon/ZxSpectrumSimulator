 AIRWOLF
 Elite 1984

 CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 AIM : As ace helicopter pilot Stringfellow Hawke, you have been
 chosen to fly the top-secret AIRWOLF helicopter. To test your prowess,
 the CIA has assigned you to a dangerous rescue mission: five important
 US scientists are being held hostage in an underground base deep
 underneath the Arizona desert. It's your task to guide AIRWOLF through
 the caverns to destroy the base's defence control boxes so that you
 can penetrate to the heart of the complex and rescue the scientists...

 GAMEPLAY : AIRWOLF bears some slight similarities to the old arcade
 classic DEFENDER, with a nod in the direction of GALAXIANS as well.
 You must shoot your way through the defence fields and electric fields
 protecting the caverns within the base, and avoid the incoming fire
 from the large and strategically-positioned guns. As well as this, you
 must also prevent the AIRWOLF from crashing into the base's walls and
 the various obstacles around it, which is not an easy task!

 COMMENTS : "Addictive, playable and fun, excellent."
 RATING : 90% (CRASH #13, February 1985)

 NOW : As they said at the time, it is a love or hate game. It is
 hard, so be warned!
