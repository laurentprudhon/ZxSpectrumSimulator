 BATTY
 Elite Software 1987

 CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 AIM : The object of the game is to knock blocks out of the court by
 bouncing a ball off your racket and hitting them. You advance to the
 next level by knocking out every block in the court.

 GAMEPLAY : Doing the above is not as easy as it sounds, as some
 blocks require more than one hit and others speed up your ball. To
 make things even more interesting, strange creatures enter from the
 top of the court and float around, causing the ball to rebound
 randomly when they touch it. These creatures also throw bombs at your
 racket which, if they hit, will destroy it. Fortunately the creatures
 will be destroyed when they come into contact with the ball.

  Some blocks release helpful features when they are knocked out. These
 must be caught by the racket to be used. Some will only last for a
 short time. The features are:

 1. Extended racket
 2. Slow ball
 3. Smart bomb      - destroys all creatures
 4. Hand            - lets you hold on to the ball
 5. Gun             - allows you to shoot the creatures and blocks
 6. Extra life
 7. Triple ball
 8. Rocket pack     - transports you to the next level
 9. Bonus points
10. Smash ball      - destroys everything in its path

  In the double play mode the court is divided into two halves and the
 players work together to clear the court.

 COMMENTS : "The best BREAKOUT clone we've seen so far."
 RATING : 85% (CRASH #44, September 1987)

 NOW : An excellent Arkanoid clone, Batty is still a very nice game to
 play. It's one of those simple games that doesn't really need flashy
 graphics to be good...
